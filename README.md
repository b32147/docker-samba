# Samba 4 + Alpine Linux Docker Image

This repository contains a basic Dockerfile for installing Samba 4
on Alpine Linux.

This is a solution for network filesharing. I use it on my self-built,
zfs-based NAS server and connect up OSX, Linux, and Windows clients.

I was previously running Netatalk for Apple AFP support, however
I've found that Samba works reasonably well for me and it appears
that [Apple may start prefering Samba over AFP](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/11/apple-shifts-from-afp-file-sharing-to-smb2-in-os-x-109-mavericks).

## Create Samba Configuration

Create the `smb.conf` configuration file. The following is an example:

```
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  server string = %h server (Samba, Alpine)
  security = user
  map to guest = Bad User
  encrypt passwords = yes
  load printers = no
  printing = bsd
  printcap name = /dev/null
  disable spoolss = yes
  disable netbios = yes
  server role = standalone
  server services = -dns, -nbt
  smb ports = 445
  name resolve order = hosts
  ;log level = 3

[Dozer]
  path = /dozer
  comment = ZFS
  browseable = yes
  writable = yes
  valid users = carol

[Shared]
  path = /share
  comment = Shared Folder
  browseable = yes
  read only = yes
  write list = carol
  guest ok = yes
```

For added security, you can control which interfaces Samba binds to and
which networks are allowed access. This is important if you're using
`--net=host` because Samba will bind to all interfaces by default and may
bind to an interface you hadn't intended. Add to the `[global]` section:

```
  hosts allow = 192.168.11.0/24 10.0.0.0/24
  hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
  interfaces = 192.168.11.0/24 10.0.0.0/24
  bind interfaces only = yes
```

I'm experimenting with the following settings (in the `[global]` section)
to add default permissions for windows clients, to enable extended features
for OSX clients, to enable recycle bins, and to be able to use ZFS's
posix-style ACLs.:

```
  create mask = 0664
  directory mask = 0775
  veto files = /.DS_Store/
  nt acl support = no
  inherit acls = yes
  ea support = yes
  vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr recycle
  acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes
  recycle:repository = .recycle
  recycle:keeptree = yes
  recycle:versions = yes
```

## Running

Add/update the `-v` volumes below to match the shares defiend in your
`smb.conf` file and run:

```
docker run -dt \
  -v $PWD/smb.conf:/etc/samba/smb.conf \
  -v $PWD/dozer:/dozer \
  -v $PWD/share:/share \
  -p 445:445 \
  --name samba \
  --restart=always \
  b32147/samba
```

You can replace `-p 445:445` with `--net=host` above if you want to use your
host's networking stack instead of Docker's proxy but it's not necessary. You
can append additional arguments for `smbd` or append `--help` for a list of
options.

## Add Users

To add a user on startup, pass arguments when running the container.

```
-e USERNAME='a_username'
-e PASSWORD='a_password'
```

Once the server is running, you can also add your users using the following:

```
docker exec -it samba adduser -s /sbin/nologin -h /home/samba -H -D a_username
docker exec -it samba smbpasswd -a a_username
```

## Check Status

Check the logs for startup errors (adjust log level in `smb.conf` if needed),
then connect a client and check the status:

```
docker logs -f --tail=100 samba
docker exec -it samba smbstatus
```

## SSDP / ZeroConf Service Discovery

For auto-discovery on Linux and OSX machines, we can use the
multicast-based mDNS and DNS-SD protocls (also known as Bonjour) using
Avahi daemon.

The main use-case for this project is for a standalone, personal or small
workgroup file server with a majority of clients on OSX or Linux. I've
made a choice to not support legacy protocols, including NetBIOS, WINS,
and the old Samba port `139`. Some of the issues with NetBIOS include
excessive broadcast packets, lack of IPV6 support, and easy spoofing.

Because of this, it means:

* For Windows clients, your Samba server won't be shown under network
  browsing. Microsoft has been adding support for DNS-SD functionality
  recently, so it's possible they will eventually support finding Samba
  shares using mDNS and DNS-SD. In the meantime, you can still connect
  directly to the IP or hostname to use the shares.

* Samba can act as a domain controller or join an NT domain but that is not
  supported with this configuration. I may put together a separate
  project that supports NetBIOS/WINS and can either join or act as a domain
  controller.
